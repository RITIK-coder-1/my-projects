Code Review:


Your code is spot on! This loop correctly sums all the numbers from 1 to 100 and stores the result in the variable sum. The logic is precise: starting from 1, it iterates up to 100 and adds each number to the sum variable.

Feedback:

Accurately sums all numbers from 1 to 100.
Clear and concise implementation using the for loop.
