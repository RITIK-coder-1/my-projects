My Code Review:


Your code to print even numbers from 2 to 20 using a while loop is correct! It starts from 2 and iterates up to 20, printing only the even numbers in that range.

Feedback:

Correctly prints even numbers from 2 to 20.
Good use of while loop and condition for checking even numbers.

Marks: 10/10

Great job!
